Currently a first-year student at the University of Minnesota.

Available for hire. My skills are: making costs go down, making profits go up.

Projects:
* [Conversations with Cowen semantic search](https://koratkar.github.io/cwt-semantic-search/)
  * To build this, I scraped the transcript log of Conversations with Tyler, embedded them using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, used a Cloudflare worker and vectorize index to store and retrieve the embeddings.
  * Why this showcases technical skills: required resourcefulness, testing each part of the Cloudflare system which I hadn't used prior, and debugging arcane errors in a systematic fashion.
  * Why this transfers to reducing costs & making profits go up: I built the system for under 10Â¢, researching several options to find the cheapest overall means. I also chose a podcast that many people listen to and would like to have search access to.
