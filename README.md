Hi, I'm Ishaan Koratkar. 

Available for hire. My skills are: making costs go down, making profits go up.

I'm 18 years old and attend the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. I'm currently set to major in statistics.

Email me: ishaan[at]koratkar.com. I love getting mail and making new friends on the internet!  
Find me on [twitter](https://x.com/whybyfire).  
My discord username: @whybyfire

More specifically: web development

Projects:
* [Conversations with Tyler semantic search](https://koratkar.github.io/cwt-semantic-search/)
  * To build this, I scraped the transcript log of Conversations with Tyler, embedded them using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, used a Cloudflare worker and vectorize index to store and retrieve the embeddings.
  * Why this showcases technical skills: required resourcefulness, testing each part of the Cloudflare system which I hadn't used prior, and debugging arcane errors in a systematic fashion.
  * Why this transfers to reducing costs & making profits go up: I built the system for under 10Â¢, researching several options to find the cheapest overall means. I also chose a podcast that many people listen to and would like to have search access to.

Courses & books:
* Fast.AI (reading currently)
* LaurieWired's [practical assembly tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKtWsuuJEDs&list=PLn_It163He32Ujm-l_czgEBhbJjOUgFhg) (reviewing currently)
* Angela Yu's [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/?srsltid=AfmBOor9wY9REAR-DnqjuFpILaAu7M-WseVWz0YOs20lkLT6nZJR4J8A) (completed in middle school)

My goals:
* Become an ML engineer
* Master the computer on the spectrum of understanding integrated circuits, assembly, and how computers interact over networks
