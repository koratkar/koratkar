Hi, I'm Ishaan Koratkar. 

Hire me if you want to win. My skills are: making costs go down, making profits go up.

I'm 18 years old and attend the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. I'm currently set to major in statistics.

Email me: ishaan[at]koratkar.com. I love getting mail and making new friends on the internet!

Projects:
* [Conversations with Tyler semantic search](https://koratkar.github.io/cwt-semantic-search/)
   * Featured on [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/wednesday-assorted-links-482.html)!
   * To build this, I scraped the transcript log of Conversations with Tyler, embedded them using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, uploaded them to a Cloudflare vectorize index, and used a Cloudflare worker to retrieve the embeddings.
   * Why this showcases technical skills: required resourcefulness, testing each part of Cloudflare systems which I hadn't used prior, and debugging arcane errors in a systematic fashion.
   * Why this transfers to reducing costs & making profits go up: I built the system for under 10Â¢, researching several options to find the cheapest overall means. I also chose a podcast that many people listen to and would like to have search access to.
* [Career Scouting](https://careerscouting.substack.com)
  * This is a set of interviews (transcriptions only) with people involved in different career paths. I conducted the interviews in 11th grade, with the hopes of finding something I'd best be fit for. I settled on ML engineering & cybersecurity as my main goals, though I also interviewed doctors, social workers, scientists, and a bouncer at a rave.
  * Why this project transfers to reducing costs & making profits go up: It demonstrates my agency, and my ability to ask important questions and find people with relevant answers.
* [Carleton College Windmill cost reduction](https://www.carleton.edu/facilities/campus-energy/wind-turbine-2/)
  * I briefly attended Carleton College in 2024, then transferred to the University of Minnesota due to a personal cost-benefit analysis on the fees. During this time, I analyzed the energy costs and found a few different ways to improve overall costs by calculating the effect of each profit and cost center on overall expenses. I reported my findings to the manager of energy.
  * Why this transfers to reducing costs & making profits go up: It demonstrates the ability to gather cost information on my own, and to consider creative ways to reduce budgets

Courses & books:
* Fast.AI (reading currently)
* LaurieWired's [practical assembly tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKtWsuuJEDs&list=PLn_It163He32Ujm-l_czgEBhbJjOUgFhg) (reviewing currently)
* Angela Yu's [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/?srsltid=AfmBOor9wY9REAR-DnqjuFpILaAu7M-WseVWz0YOs20lkLT6nZJR4J8A) (completed in middle school)

My goals:
* Become an ML engineer
* Master the computer on the spectrum of understanding integrated circuits, assembly language, and how computers interact over networks
